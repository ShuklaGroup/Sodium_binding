## final_MSM_obj.pkl
This file can be downloaded from https://uofi.box.com/s/n8a15pcabkh8fzd42hecxh2mkhz1fzh3. It contains optimal MSM object for CB1 and CB2. 

## bootstraping
This folder can be downloaded from https://uofi.box.com/s/n8a15pcabkh8fzd42hecxh2mkhz1fzh3. It contains 200 bootstrap samples for CB1 and CB2 and corresponding MSMs with same state index as reference MSM.
